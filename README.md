Notes on differences in this fork
---------------------------------
* vbmod module is separated from demo, examples and plotting code
* separated matplotlib components from core module
* added simple ring example generator, modeling and visualization
* demo scripts from original repo moved to sub directory
* removed alternative optimized weave (c) code from original (this code doesn't work properly in the original code)


ORIGINAL README
---------------

introduction
------------
vbmod_python is python software for identifying modules in networks
(e.g. "community detection"), as described in "a bayesian approach to
network modularity."

this software is free for scientific use. please contact us if you
plan to use this software for commercial purposes. do not further
distribute without prior permission of the authors. if used in your
scientific work, please cite as:

Modularity", Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 258701 (2008) 


installation
------------
vbmod_python doesn't require any installation, but does require the
scipy package (http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy). 

it currently defaults to a version that uses weave
(http://www.scipy.org/Weave) to include inline c code for better
performance in the vbmod_estep_inline. (a version of this code in
python is left as a comment, and can be used in lieu of the weave code
in the event of compilation problems, etc.)

weave will take some time to compile the c code on the first run, but
be much faster than the corresponding python code. this speedup arises
because there is a for loop over nodes in the code, which is extremely
slow when interpreted by python.


demo
----
run 'vbmod.py' which generates an adjacency matrix for a modular
random network and runs variational bayes to infer the modular
structure from this adjacency matrix.

see documentation in files for further information.

>Note: Examples are vbmod_demo_large.py, vbmod_demo_small.py and simple_example.py
